NLP TF-IDF technique 

The Code utilizes a news data sample for text analysis. It calculates the tf-idf score for the content and title of every data sample. Then it utilizes Matching score technique to relate a query with similar data sample. This is also acheived using cosine similarity.

The alpha value for weightage is assumed 0.7 giving more weightage to content then title.

The Train and test split ratio is 0.8

Inspiration for preprocessing data is taken from Krish Naik Youtube videos and similarity application is inspired from toward data science material
